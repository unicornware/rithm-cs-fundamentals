# Searching Algorithms Exercise

1. `linearSearch`

   This function should accept an array and value and return the index at which
   the value exists or `-1` if the value can not be found. Do **not** use
   `indexOf` to solve this! This function should use iteration not recursion.

2. `linearSearchRecursive`

   If you have not yet implemented this (it is a bonus in the [recursion
   exercise][1]). This function should accept an array and value and return the
   index at which the value exists or `-1` if the value can not be found. Do
   **not** use `indexOf` to solve this! This function should use iteration not
   recursion.

3. `binarySearch`

   This function should accept an array and value and return the index at which
   the value exists or `-1` if the value can not be found. Do **not** use
   `indexOf` to solve this! This function should use iteration not recursion.
   Make sure that your algorithm runs in `O(log(n))` and not `O(n)`.

4. `binarySearchRecursive`

   If you have not yet implemented this (it is a bonus in the [recursion
   exercise][1]). This function should accept an array and value and return the
   index at which the value exists or `-1` if the value can not be found. Do
   **not** use `indexOf` to solve this! This function should use recursion. Make
   sure that your algorithm runs in `O(log(n))` and not `O(n)`.
