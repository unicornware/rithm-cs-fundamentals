1. `mergeSort`

   Implement merge sort. Your function should accept an array and return an
   array of sorted values. Solve this using helper method recursion (your helper
   functon should be called `merge`).

2. `quickSort`

   Implement quick sort. Your function should accept an array and return an
   array of sorted values. Solve this using helper method recursion (your helper
   functon should be called `pivot`).
